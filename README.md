Intro projects for CUDA programming
===================================

I've moved my personal work with the needed support code into the HW* directories.
The code should work with Linux and Visual Studio under CUDA SDK version 8.

The code is originally sourced from Udacity's Introduction to CUDA Programming (cs344).

## Dependencies
The code requires a properly installed OpenCV and CUDA SDK.

# Building on OS X

These instructions are for OS X 10.9 "Mavericks".

* Step 1. Build and install OpenCV. The best way to do this is with
Homebrew. However, you must slightly alter the Homebrew OpenCV
installation; you must build it with libstdc++ (instead of the default
libc++) so that it will properly link against the nVidia CUDA dev kit. 
[This entry in the Udacity discussion forums](http://forums.udacity.com/questions/100132476/cuda-55-opencv-247-os-x-maverick-it-doesnt-work) describes exactly how to build a compatible OpenCV.

* Step 2. You can now create 10.9-compatible makefiles, which will allow you to
build and run your homework on your own machine:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
